                Modesto was a proud Marine. His accolades include numerous Certifications of Good Conduct. He also was a Lance Corporal in the Marines, and earned a degree in the Naval Aviation Maintenance Unit. Modesto was also an esteemed 911 Citywide Dispatcher, who handled many high profile emergency incidents, including the 911 attack in New York, in which he worked Ground Zero.

                Modesto has also trained for over 40 years in the art of Jujitsu. He holds a 1st degree black belt in Sanuces Ryu Jujitsu and a 3rd degree black belt in Goju. 

                Modesto was a loving son, husband, father and grandfather. He made a lasting and memorable impact on everyone he came across. We're going to miss seeing him in his vast collection of shorts and sneakers, which he proudly wore, no matter what the season was. Heaven gained the most lively angel imaginable, and we all gained a loving guide in the sky.
